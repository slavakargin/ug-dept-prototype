# Undergraduate Program — Current Students (Prototype)

This site is the **department-side hub for current Mathematical Sciences students**: advising, forms, degree planning, and other information that changes over time.

For **program overview and track descriptions** (stable content), see {{UNIV_UG_LANDING}}.

## Start here

### Advising
- **How to get advising / who to contact:** [Advising hub](current-students/advising.md)
- Common questions:
  - changing tracks (Math / Actuarial / Data Science & Statistics)
  - prerequisite or course-substitution requests
  - planning for graduation and electives

### Forms and petitions
- [Forms & petitions](current-students/forms.md)  
  (prerequisite exceptions, substitutions, transfer/course equivalencies, etc.)

### Degree planning
- [Degree planning resources](current-students/degree-planning.md)  
  (planning sheets, sample pathways, and “what to take next” guidance)

### Policies and logistics
- [Policies and logistics](current-students/policies.md)  
  (items that may vary by semester/year)

## Notes (prototype)
This is a working draft intended to support a redesign where:
- stable program descriptions live on the university website, and
- frequently updated student-facing logistics live here.
