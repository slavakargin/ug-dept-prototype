# Advising

This page is for **current Mathematical Sciences majors/minors** seeking advising on planning, requirements, and common petitions. For stable program descriptions and track summaries, see {{UNIV_UG_LANDING}}.

## Who to contact
- **General advising hub:** (add link / location once decided)
- **Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS):** (add contact)
- **Harpur Advising:** (add contact / office page)

> **Tip:** When you email, include your B-number, your major/track, and what semester you plan to graduate.

## What we can help with
- Choosing a track (Mathematics / Actuarial Science / Data Science & Statistics)
- Planning a semester-by-semester schedule (including prerequisites)
- Confirming how a course applies to requirements
- Petitions (prerequisite exceptions, substitutions, transfer credit evaluation)

## How to prepare for an advising meeting
Bring (or email ahead of time):
- Your current plan (what you’ve taken + what you plan next)
- Questions you want answered
- Any relevant documents (transfer syllabi, unofficial transcript, DegreeWorks notes)

## Common questions
### “What should I take next?”
Usually depends on your current level:
- Early stage: calculus sequence + linear algebra
- Mid stage: core proof/upper-level gateways (varies by track)
- Late stage: electives aligned with goals (grad school, industry, teaching)

(Replace with brief track-specific guidance once you decide where it lives.)

### “DegreeWorks doesn’t match what I expect”
DegreeWorks is helpful but not perfect. If something looks wrong, contact advising and include:
- screenshots of the relevant blocks
- a list of courses you believe satisfy each requirement

## Official requirements (authoritative)
- BA requirements: [Academic Guide -- BA]({{BU_ACADEMIC_GUIDE_MATH_BA}})
- BS requirements: [Academic Guide -- BS]({{BU_ACADEMIC_GUIDE_MATH_BS}})
