# Degree planning

This page focuses on **planning and sequencing** (what to take when). For stable track descriptions, see {{UNIV_UG_LANDING}}.

## Step 1: Identify your track and goals
- Track: Mathematics / Actuarial Science / Data Science & Statistics
- Goals: grad school, teaching, industry, double major/minor, study abroad, etc.

## Step 2: Check the official requirements
Use the catalog/Academic Guide as the authoritative source:
- BA requirements: {{BU_ACADEMIC_GUIDE_MATH_BA}}
- BS requirements: {{BU_ACADEMIC_GUIDE_MATH_BS}}

## Step 3: Build a semester-by-semester plan
A good plan should:
- respect prerequisites
- leave room for GenEd / second major/minor
- include at least 2–3 “backup” electives (in case of scheduling conflicts)

### Sample 4-year plan templates
Harpur Advising maintains 4-year plan templates:
- Templates hub: {{BU_HARPUR_MAJOR_MINOR_ADVISING_TEMPLATES}}

(If you maintain department planning sheets, link them here.)

## Step 4: Review once per semester
Update your plan each semester after registration:
- adjust for course availability
- check progress in DegreeWorks
- confirm remaining requirements with advising if anything is unclear

## Practical experience (where applicable)
Some tracks encourage or require a practical experience (internship, research, consulting course).
- How to satisfy/verify: (add link or brief guidance)
